# Virtual IoT Sensor Node - Project Plan

## Overview
This project simulates a virtual IoT temperature sensor node using Arduino code.  
The goal is to build a modular embedded systems project to improve my skills in IoT, sensor interfacing, and data processing.

## Technologies Used
- Arduino C++ for sensor simulation  
- Git for version control  
- GitHub for remote repository  
- macOS Terminal for development environment

## Current Status
- Created Arduino code to simulate temperature sensor readings  
- Set up GitHub repository with proper folder structure

## Next Steps
- Add wireless communication simulation (e.g., MQTT publish)  
- Implement data smoothing and filtering techniques  
- Document project with screenshots and additional notes  
- Explore integration with Python for data visualization

## Learning Goals
- Understand embedded IoT device workflows  
- Gain hands-on experience with Arduino programming  
- Master Git and GitHub for project management  
- Prepare for future hardware implementation
